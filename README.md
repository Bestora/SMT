SMT by palle
Server Monitoring & Management Tool

SMT was developed by an administrator for administrators. It is intended to simplify everyday life with different systems and to notify the right employees of the right events. This includes, of course, a sensible and meaningful system administration.

With SMT, you can monitor different services and services, configure reminders, and work with regular expressions.

SMT generates an exportable IP address list from the captured systems, and you can use SMT to scan your network for devices and systems. Furthermore, we have a portscanner with reference table installed, if it is a known port, the corresponding name / purpose is displayed and saved to the system.

A special feature is the built-in "DNS Checker", which is called once a day (cronjob) and then lists all known DNS errors to the registered systems, this is very helpful in this day and age. By the simple provision of system via virtualization one can lose the overview.

In addition, we have integrated a license and inventory management that allows the IT department to easily inventory and license hardware devices or images.

* Server management
